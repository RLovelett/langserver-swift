    /// This extension may eventually become part of the stdlib. It has been proposed as SE-100.
    ///
    /// Creates a new dictionary using the key/value pairs in the given sequence.
    ///
    /// - Parameter sequence:  A sequence of `(Key, Value)` tuples, where the type `Key` conforms to
    ///   the `Hashable` protocol.
    /// - Returns: A new dictionary initialized with the elements of `sequence`. If `Key` is
    ///   duplicated then the last value encountered will be the value in the dictionary.
    ///
    /// - Remark: This extension was initially based on the code provided for Swift-Evolution #100
    ///   (SE-100). However, that initializer is failable. Since we do not care about duplicates or
    ///   failures on duplicates that part of the `for-in` loop has been removed. This increases our
    ///   code-coverage amount without having to add and maintain a test.
    ///
